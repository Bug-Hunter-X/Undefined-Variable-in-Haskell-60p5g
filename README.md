# Haskell Undefined Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell: using an undefined variable.  The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version. The error arises from attempting to use a variable that hasn't been assigned a value, leading to a runtime exception.
